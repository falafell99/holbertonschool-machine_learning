## Task 0: Determinant
File: 0-determinant.py

Function that calculates the determinant of a square matrix recursively using Laplace expansion.

Features:
- Handles 0x0 matrix ([[]]) returns 1
- Validates input: must be list of lists, must be square
- Recursive implementation for any size matrix
- Base cases: 1x1 and 2x2 matrices
